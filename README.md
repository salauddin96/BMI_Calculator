A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a simple tool used to estimate an individual's body fat based on their height and weight. BMI is a numerical value that categorizes a person's weight status into different ranges, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. It's a widely used method for assessing whether a person's weight is within a healthy range.

Here's how a typical BMI calculator works:

Input: Users provide their height (usually in meters or feet) and weight (usually in kilograms or pounds).

Calculation: The BMI is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = (Weight in kilograms) / (Height in meters)^2

or

BMI = (Weight in pounds) / (Height in inches)^2 * 703

Classification: Based on the calculated BMI value, users are categorized into different weight status groups. These categories often include:

Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal Weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity (Class 1): BMI between 30 and 34.9
Obesity (Class 2): BMI between 35 and 39.9
Obesity (Class 3): BMI of 40 or greater (severe obesity)
Display: The BMI value and corresponding weight status category are displayed to the user.
